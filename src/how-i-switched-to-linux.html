		<h1>How I Switched To Linux</h1>

		<p>
			I’ve grown up on Windows 7 and 10, and for the most part, I’ve had no issues with them. However, recently
			I’ve been lucky enough to be in a community where Linux was practically everyone’s daily driver, and it sort
			of began to rub off on me. At some point, I got bored of Windows and finally decided that I should try
			Linux. And so I did.
		</p>
		<p>
			I spent a few days trying out different distributions. I wanted something practical: something less
			spoonfeed-y than Windows, but nothing that would be a nightmare to get into or troubleshoot. My trial
			process was neither systematic nor robust — I tried out only a small handful of distributions, and judged
			mostly by first impressions — but in the end, two of them caught my eye: <a href="https://getsol.us/">Solus</a>
			and <a href="https://zorin.com/os/">Zorin</a>. In the end, I decided to go for Zorin, mostly because it’s
			Ubuntu-based and therefore there’s an abundance of both apps and support for it.
		</p>
		<figure class="horizontal-centered">
			<img src="./assets/images/zorin.png" width="1366" height="768" alt="Screenshot of the Zorin OS 16 desktop">

		</figure>
		<p>
			It took me a moment to appreciate GNOME. After spending a few days trying and failing to theme it to look
			like Windows 10 (I really liked sharp corners), I gave up and just rolled with it. It didn't take all that
			long for me to warm up to it. The filesystem structure was a bit new to me, but it wasn’t anything that a
			little bit of learning couldn't remedy. I found a new workflow in a matter of days. Zorin still has a few
			annoyances which simply aren’t present on Windows (see below), but also has its own benefits, which are too
			numerous to list here and have already been documented thoroughly elsewhere on the internet.
		</p>
		<p>
			The switch was far from painless, however. I hit countless issues and roadblocks, some of which I’ve
			resolved only thanks to the help of some friends. Following is a list of all the problems I’ve encountered,
			past and present, as well as all the solutions I’ve attempted. This list may seem dauntingly long, but it
			was — and still is — completely worth it.

					<li>
						Some faint memory tells me that I had this issue on Windows 10 too and fixed it via	some Radeon
						(I had an AMD card at that time) setting about color formats or something. Changing a similar
						setting under NVIDIA’s control panel had no effect.

					<li>
						Tweaked some NVIDIA settings, mainly the gamma setting, and while the colors still aren’t

					</li>
					<li>Perhaps it’s all just a matter of viewing angle and I just need a taller monitor stand?</li>
					<li>
						This took me a while to figure out, and it had nothing to do with the monitor or the GPU. First,
						I narrowed the issue down to only Electron apps, like VS Code and Discord. Then, I found out
						that Zorin (or Ubuntu?) has this setting called ‘Device Color Profiles’, and my monitor had some
						default profile applied. I just removed it and colors started being correct.

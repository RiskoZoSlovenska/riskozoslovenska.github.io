It is a standard H2 male, aged approximately 13 H1-years. Mean height is 97 cm and weight is 43 kg. The subject is in good physical health. Subject is brough into a standard class-A decompression chamber by guards without protest. It is laid in the middle of the chamber. The guards exit and the chamber's door is closed remotely.</p><p>Subject stands up and shows signs of distress. It proceeds to the door and pleads to be let out.</p><p>At <code>00:00:00</code>, atmospheric pressure in the chamber is measured at 100.3 kPa and temperature at 24.3 °C.</p><p>At <code>00:00:10</code>, depressurization begins. Subject's fur stands vertically as air is rapidly evacuated from the chamber through the perforated ceiling.</p><p>At <code>00:00:11</code>, subject collapses to its knees.</p><p>At <code>00:00:12</code>, subject's skin swells slightly; this is believed to be the result of ebullism.</p><p>At <code>00:00:13</code>, pressure is measured at 5 kPa; temperature is at -30 °C. Thermal cameras show that the subject's surface body temperature has dropped to about 10 °C.</p><p>At <code>00:00:16</code>, subject collapses onto the chamber floor and emits a wheezing sound. It emits a weak, choked cry, and begins to cry.</p><p>At <code>00:00:20</code>, blood is seen welling from the subject's years, eyes, mouth, nose and multiple places on the chest. Subject's surface body temperature remains at about 10 °C.</p><p>At <code>00:00:25</code>, subject convulses and begins coughing up quantifiable amounts of blood and internal tissue.</p><p>At <code>00:00:43</code>, subject ceases movement. Surface body temperature is measured at 8 °C.</p><p>At <code>00:00:50</code>, chamber begins re-pressurization. No changes to subject.</p><p>At <code>00:01:00</code>, chamber pressure is measured at 98.5 kPa and temperature at 32.2 °C. The door is opened and the subject is retrieved without incident.</p><p>After the conclusion of the test, the subject was placed into a standard type-III REGSYS for 10 hours and made a full recovery. Subject displayed post-traumatic symptoms for about 4 months following the test, predominantly when left alone in a room. More frequent visits to organism <code>GS-5-2356</code> were allowed.</p><code>Test Log 220112-1 END</code></main>

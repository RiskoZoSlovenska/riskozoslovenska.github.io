## Rapid Decompression Test
To determine the effects of rapid atmospheric decompression on a member of species GS-5.

Organism `GS-5-1132` will be used for the test, and referred to as the subject. It is a standard H2 male, aged approximately 13 H1-years. Mean height is 97 cm and weight is 43 kg. The subject is in good physical health.
Subject is brough into a standard class-A decompression chamber by guards without protest. It is laid in the middle of the chamber. The guards exit and the chamber's door is closed remotely.

Subject stands up and shows signs of distress. It proceeds to the door and pleads to be let out.

At `00:00:00`, atmospheric pressure in the chamber is measured at 100.3 kPa and temperature at 24.3 °C.

At `00:00:10`, depressurization begins. Subject's fur stands vertically as air is rapidly evacuated from the chamber through the perforated ceiling.

At `00:00:11`, subject collapses to its knees.

At `00:00:12`, subject's skin swells slightly; this is believed to be the result of ebullism.

At `00:00:13`, pressure is measured at 5 kPa; temperature is at -30 °C. Thermal cameras show that the subject's surface body temperature has dropped to about 10 °C.

At `00:00:16`, subject collapses onto the chamber floor and emits a wheezing sound. It emits a weak, choked cry, and begins to cry.

At `00:00:20`, blood is seen welling from the subject's years, eyes, mouth, nose and multiple places on the chest. Subject's surface body temperature remains at about 10 °C.

At `00:00:25`, subject convulses and begins coughing up quantifiable amounts of blood and internal tissue.

At `00:00:43`, subject ceases movement. Surface body temperature is measured at 8 °C.

At `00:00:50`, chamber begins re-pressurization. No changes to subject.

At `00:01:00`, chamber pressure is measured at 98.5 kPa and temperature at 32.2 °C. The door is opened and the subject is retrieved without incident.

After the conclusion of the test, the subject was placed into a standard type-III REGSYS for 10 hours and made a full recovery. Subject displayed post-traumatic symptomps for about 4 months following the test, predominantly when left alone in a room. More frequent visits to organism GS-5-2356 were allowed.

		<h1>How I Switched To Linux</h1>
		<figure class="float-right">
			<img src="./ntfs.png" width="364" height="149" alt="Screenshot of six files with the same name on Windows 7">
			<figcaption>I stumbled upon this while clearing out my old Win 7 laptop. And yes, those are all unique and in the
				same folder.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			I’ve grown up on Windows 7 and 10, and for the most part, I’ve had no issues with them. However, recently
			I’ve been lucky enough to be in a community where Linux was practically everyone’s daily driver and it sort
			of began to rub off on me. I don’t remember what exactly made me make the switch, but I had heard good
			things about Linux and at some point I just took the leap of faith.
		</p>
		<p>
			I spent a few days trying out different Linux distributions. I wanted something practical: something less
			spoonfeed-y than Windows, but nothing that would be a nightmare to get into or troubleshoot. I admit, my
			trial process was neither systematic nor robust — I tried out only a small handful of distros, and judged
			mostly by first impressions — but in the end, two distros caught my attention: Solus and Zorin. In the end,
			I decided to go for Zorin, mostly because it’s Ubuntu-based and therefore there’s an abundance of both apps
			and troubleshooting resources for it.
		</p>
		<figure class="horizontal-centered">
			<img src="./zorin.png" width="1366" height="768" alt="Screenshot of the Zorin OS 16 desktop">
			<figcaption>Random but authentic screenshot I took while triaging Zorin.</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			It took me a moment to appreciate GNOME. After spending a few days trying and failing to theme it to look like Windows 10
			(I really liked sharp corners), I gave up and just rolled with it. The filesystem structure was a bit new to me,
			but it wasn’t anything that a little bit of research and asking around couldn’t fix. I found a new workflow in
			a matter of days. Looking back, Zorin still has a few annoyances which simply aren’t present on Windows (see below),
			but also has its own benefits, which are too numerous to list here and have already been documented thoroughly elsewhere
			on the internet.
		</p>
		<p>
			The switch was far from painless. I hit countless issues and nuisances, some of which I’ve resolved only
			thanks to the help of some friends. Following is a list of all the problems I’ve encountered, past and
			present, as well as all the solutions I’ve attempted. This list may seem dauntingly long, but it was and
			still is worth it.
